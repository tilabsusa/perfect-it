# Sprint Change Proposal: Husky/Prettier Configuration Fix

**Date:** 2025-01-08  
**Author:** Bob (Scrum Master)  
**Trigger:** Git commit failures due to overly broad pre-commit hook scope

## 1. Analysis Summary

### Issue Identified

During Story 1.1 (Initialize Amplify Project and Repository Setup), the Husky pre-commit hooks with Prettier were blocking git commits by checking ALL project files, including non-source directories that should not be formatted or linted (.bmad-core, .claude, docs, etc.). This prevented developers from saving work to the repository.

### Root Cause

The initial configuration in Task 5 of Story 1.1 set up ESLint and Prettier without proper ignore files, causing the pre-commit hooks to check 74+ files outside the source code directories.

### Impact Assessment

- **Immediate Impact:** Development workflow blocked until resolved
- **Epic Impact:** None - issue contained within Story 1.1
- **Future Impact:** Would have affected all future development if not fixed

## 2. Resolution Implemented

### Technical Fix (Completed by Dev Agent)

The following configuration changes were implemented:

1. **Created `.eslintignore`** - Excludes non-source directories from linting
2. **Created `.prettierignore`** - Excludes non-source directories from formatting checks
3. **Modified `.husky/pre-commit`** - Updated to only check source code directories:

   ```bash
   npm run lint

   # Check only source code directories
   npx prettier --check "app/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,css}" "lib/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}" "amplify/**/*.{js,ts}"
   ```

### Verification

- Pre-commit hooks now function correctly
- Only actual source code is checked for linting and formatting
- Git commits work as expected

## 3. Proposed Documentation Updates

### Story 1.1 File List Update

Add the following to the Dev Agent Record - File List section:

- `.eslintignore` (created)
- `.prettierignore` (created)
- `.husky/pre-commit` (modified with focused scope)

## 4. Lessons Learned for Future Projects

### Issue Prevention Guidelines

For future projects using the BMad Method with similar tech stack:

**Problem to Avoid:**

- Default Husky/Prettier configuration attempts to check ALL files in the project
- This includes documentation, configuration, and tool-specific directories that shouldn't be formatted

**Best Practice Solution:**

1. **Always create ignore files during initial setup:**

   - `.eslintignore` - Define directories to exclude from linting
   - `.prettierignore` - Define directories to exclude from formatting

2. **Configure pre-commit hooks with focused scope:**

   ```bash
   # Only check actual source code directories
   npx prettier --check "app/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,css}" "lib/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}" "amplify/**/*.{js,ts}"
   ```

3. **Common directories to exclude:**
   - `.bmad-core/` - BMad Method files
   - `.claude/` - Claude AI workspace
   - `.ignore/` - Project documentation
   - `docs/` - Documentation (unless you want to format markdown)
   - Build outputs (`.next/`, `.amplify/`, `dist/`, etc.)
   - Dependencies (`node_modules/`)

### Recommended BMad Method Enhancement

Consider updating the BMad story template for "Project Initialization" stories to include:

- Explicit step for creating linting/formatting ignore files
- Pre-configured ignore patterns for common BMad project structures
- Validation step to ensure pre-commit hooks don't check non-source files

## 5. Path Forward

### Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate:** Continue development with fixed configuration ✅
2. **Documentation:** Update Story 1.1 file list (minor update)
3. **Future:** Consider incorporating this learning into BMad templates

### Risk Assessment

- **Risk Level:** LOW - Issue fully resolved
- **Regression Risk:** None - fix improves stability
- **Future Risk:** Mitigated through documentation

## 6. Approval and Next Steps

### Status

- **Issue Resolution:** COMPLETE
- **Documentation:** PENDING (minor Story 1.1 update)
- **Handoff Required:** None - can proceed with normal development

### Success Criteria

✅ Git commits function normally  
✅ Only source code is checked by pre-commit hooks  
✅ Development workflow is unblocked  
✅ Lesson learned is documented for future projects

### Agent Handoff Plan

No handoff required. Development can continue normally with Dev agent.

# Sprint Change Proposal - Package Version Updates
**Date:** 2025-01-08  
**Trigger:** Story 1.1 Implementation Issues  
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

## Identified Issue Summary
During Story 1.1 implementation, multiple npm package version incompatibilities were discovered between the specified tech stack versions and actual requirements for a working development environment.

## Package Issues Discovered
1. **ESLint**: v8.56.0 (specified) → v8.57.1 (required for Next.js compatibility)
2. **Playwright**: v1.41.0 (specified) → v1.41.2 (required to resolve dependencies)
3. **Husky**: v9.0.0 (specified) → v9.1.7 (actual version installed)
4. **Missing package**: @aws-amplify/adapter-nextjs v1.6.8 (not originally specified, but required)

## Epic Impact Summary
- **Current Epic (Epic 1):** No impact - Story 1.1 completed successfully with adjusted versions
- **Future Epics (2-5):** No structural changes required - will benefit from corrected documentation

## Artifact Adjustment Needs
1. **docs/architecture/tech-stack.md** - Update package versions to reflect working configurations

## Recommended Path Forward
**Direct Adjustment** - Update documentation with correct package versions discovered during implementation. No code rollback or re-architecting required.

## PRD MVP Impact
None - MVP scope and goals remain unchanged.

## Implemented Changes

### docs/architecture/tech-stack.md Updates
1. **Line 18:** Added new entry for Amplify Adapter Next.js v1.6.8
2. **Line 30:** Updated Playwright from 1.41.0 → 1.41.2
3. **Line 31:** Updated ESLint from 8.56.0 → 8.57.1
4. **Line 33:** Updated Husky from 9.0.0 → 9.1.7

## Validation
- Tech stack documentation now reflects actual working versions
- Future stories will reference correct versions without conflicts
- No npm install errors expected in subsequent story implementations

## Approval Chain
- **Proposed by:** Scrum Master (Bob)
- **Reviewed by:** User
- **Implemented by:** Architect (Winston)
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

# PerfectIt Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Enable users to find and share specific, visual improvement guidance for any item through community-contributed Perfection Cards
- Create a searchable repository where DIY enthusiasts can transform "good enough" items into "perfect" through proven techniques
- Build an engaged community where experts preserve and share craft knowledge while gaining recognition
- Achieve 1,000 registered users and 500+ Perfection Cards demonstrating active content creation and consumption
- Establish PerfectIt as the go-to platform for visual, item-specific improvement knowledge

### Background Context

PerfectIt addresses a fundamental gap in the improvement knowledge ecosystem: while people can easily identify imperfections in items around them, they lack specific, actionable guidance on how to achieve perfection. Current solutions like YouTube tutorials and DIY forums provide general instruction but fail to connect specific items with their improvement paths. This platform transforms scattered expertise into an organized, visual-first repository where every improvement guide directly corresponds to a specific item or situation.

The timing is critical as the maker movement accelerates and consumers increasingly value quality, sustainability, and craftsmanship. By creating "Perfection Cards" that pair item images with step-by-step improvement instructions, PerfectIt bridges the gap between seeing and doing, making expert knowledge accessible to anyone seeking to perfect their possessions.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The PerfectIt interface embodies visual storytelling, where every interaction begins with an image. The design philosophy centers on "show, don't tell" - users should immediately understand an item's improvement potential through visual cues. The interface maintains a clean, uncluttered aesthetic that puts Perfection Cards front and center, with intuitive navigation that feels familiar to users of Pinterest and Instagram while offering the structured guidance of instructional platforms.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Visual-First Discovery:** Grid-based card browsing with prominent images, hover-to-preview details
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Cards expand from image thumbnail → summary → full instructions
- **Contextual Actions:** Upvote, save, and share buttons appear on hover/touch without cluttering the view
- **Guided Creation Flow:** Step-by-step wizard for creating Perfection Cards with real-time preview
- **Community Engagement:** Inline commenting and discussion threads that don't disrupt the visual flow

### Core Screens and Views

- Login/Registration Screen (social login options, minimal friction onboarding)
- Home Dashboard (personalized feed of trending and recommended Perfection Cards)
- Browse/Discover Page (category grid, filter sidebar, infinite scroll)
- Search Results Page (visual grid with relevance indicators)
- Perfection Card Detail View (hero image, instructions, materials, comments)
- Create Card Wizard (multi-step form with image upload, preview mode)
- User Profile Page (expertise badges, contributed cards, saved collections)
- My Collections Page (organized saved cards in custom folders)

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

- Full keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatible with proper ARIA labels
- High contrast mode option
- Alt text for all images
- Focus indicators and skip navigation links

### Branding

Clean, modern aesthetic with craft-inspired touches. Warm, approachable color palette emphasizing earth tones and workshop colors (wood browns, tool grays, creative oranges). Typography balances readability with personality - clear sans-serif for instructions, subtle serif accents for headers. Visual language celebrates craftsmanship and improvement journey.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

- Desktop-first design optimized for content creation and detailed browsing
- Fully responsive mobile experience for on-the-go discovery and reference
- Touch-optimized interactions for tablets and phones
- Progressive Web App capabilities for app-like mobile experience

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

Single repository containing the Next.js frontend and AWS Amplify Gen 2 backend configuration. This simplifies dependency management, enables atomic commits across the stack, and aligns with Amplify Gen 2's project structure. All application code, Amplify backend definitions, and configurations live in one version-controlled location.

### Service Architecture

**AWS Amplify Gen 2 Serverless Architecture** - Fully serverless application leveraging Amplify's managed services. Backend consists of AppSync GraphQL API with resolvers connecting to DynamoDB tables, Lambda functions for custom business logic, and Amplify Auth for authentication. This approach provides automatic scaling, reduced operational overhead, and tight integration with AWS services while maintaining clear separation between data, auth, storage, and function resources.

### Testing Requirements

**Unit + Integration Testing** focused on critical paths. Unit tests for React components and custom hooks. Integration tests for Lambda functions and GraphQL resolvers. Manual testing convenience methods for UI workflows. Test coverage target of 70% for Lambda functions and critical UI components, focusing on Perfection Card CRUD operations and search functionality.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js with React and TypeScript, using App Router for optimal performance
- **UI Component Library:** Amplify UI React for connected components, Material-UI (MUI) v5 for additional UI needs
- **Amplify UI Components:** Authenticator, FileUploader, StorageImage, Collection, Card, Avatar for core functionality
- **State Management:** Amplify DataStore for offline-first data synchronization, Amplify UI connected components, React Context for UI state
- **Backend Framework:** AWS Amplify Gen 2 with AppSync GraphQL API
- **Database:** DynamoDB via Amplify Data, with single-table design pattern for optimal performance
- **Image Storage:** Amplify Storage (S3) with CloudFront CDN for image delivery
- **Authentication:** Amplify Auth (Cognito) with social login providers (Google, Facebook)
- **Search Implementation:** DynamoDB with GSI for basic search, OpenSearch integration for advanced search
- **Image Processing:** Lambda function with Sharp library triggered on S3 upload events
- **API Design:** GraphQL schema with type-safe code generation via Amplify Codegen
- **Development Tools:** ESLint, Prettier, Husky for pre-commit hooks, Amplify CLI
- **CI/CD:** Amplify Hosting with automatic branch deployments and preview environments
- **Hosting:** AWS Amplify Hosting for frontend, Amplify backend services for API/data
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch for logs and metrics, X-Ray for distributed tracing
- **Rate Limiting:** AppSync API throttling and request limits
- **Content Moderation:** Manual flagging with admin review queue in DynamoDB
- **File Upload:** Amplify UI FileUploader component with Amplify Storage integration
- **Real-time Features:** AppSync subscriptions for live updates on comments and votes

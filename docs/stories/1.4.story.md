## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 1.3 completed the authentication UI implementation:
- Amplify UI Authenticator fully integrated at `app/(auth)/login` and `app/(auth)/register`
- `components/ui/AmplifyProvider.tsx` wraps the application with Amplify configuration
- Authentication pages redirect to `/dashboard` after successful login
- `app/layout.tsx` already includes AmplifyProvider wrapper
- Authentication state can be accessed using Amplify's `getCurrentUser()` or `useAuthenticator` hook

### Component Specifications

**Navigation Component** (`components/ui/Navigation.tsx`):
- Use MUI AppBar component as the base
- Include Toolbar component for content alignment
- Use IconButton for mobile menu toggle
- Implement Menu/MenuItem for user dropdown
- Avatar component for authenticated user display

**Drawer Component** (`components/ui/Drawer.tsx`):
- Use MUI Drawer with temporary variant for mobile
- SwipeableDrawer for iOS momentum scrolling
- List/ListItem components for navigation items
- Divider to separate sections

**Footer Component** (`components/ui/Footer.tsx`):
- Use MUI Box/Container for layout
- Typography components for text
- Link components for navigation
- Grid system for responsive columns

### File Locations

Based on the project structure:
- Landing page: `app/page.tsx` (already exists, needs update)
- Navigation: `components/ui/Navigation.tsx` (new file)
- Drawer: `components/ui/Drawer.tsx` (new file)
- Footer: `components/ui/Footer.tsx` (new file)
- SEO component: `components/common/SEO.tsx` (new file)
- Root layout: `app/layout.tsx` (exists, needs update)

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

### MUI Theme Configuration

The project uses Material-UI (MUI) 5.15.0 with a custom theme configuration located at `lib/theme/theme.ts`. The theme should be applied consistently across all new components using the MUI ThemeProvider that's already set up.

MUI components to use:
- AppBar, Toolbar, IconButton, Button, Menu, MenuItem, Avatar (Navigation)
- Drawer, SwipeableDrawer, List, ListItem, ListItemText, Divider (Mobile menu)
- Container, Box, Grid, Typography, Link (Layout and content)

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md - Material-UI (MUI) 5.15.0]

### Authentication Integration

From Story 1.3, authentication is handled by:
- Amplify Authenticator at `/login` and `/register`
- `getCurrentUser()` from `aws-amplify/auth` for checking auth state
- `useAuthenticator` hook from `@aws-amplify/ui-react` for reactive auth state
- Sign out using `signOut()` from `aws-amplify/auth`

[Source: Story 1.3 completion notes]

### Responsive Breakpoints

Use MUI's standard breakpoints:
- xs: 0px
- sm: 600px
- md: 900px
- lg: 1200px
- xl: 1536px

Mobile navigation drawer should appear below `md` breakpoint.

### SEO Requirements

Next.js 14.2 App Router metadata API should be used:
```typescript
export const metadata = {
  title: 'PerfectIt - Share Your Perfect Moments',
  description: 'Discover and share perfectly executed ideas, designs, and solutions',
  openGraph: {
    title: 'PerfectIt',
    description: 'Share Your Perfect Moments',
    images: ['/og-image.png'],
  },
  twitter: {
    card: 'summary_large_image',
  },
}
```

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md - Next.js 14.2.0]

### Testing Requirements

**Framework**: Jest 29.7.0 + React Testing Library

**Coverage Target**: 80% for components

**Test Requirements**:
- Test navigation renders correctly
- Test authenticated vs unauthenticated states
- Test mobile drawer functionality
- Test SEO meta tags are present
- Mock Amplify auth methods using MSW

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 1.2 completed the backend authentication infrastructure:
- Cognito configured with email/password and OAuth providers (Google, Facebook)
- User groups defined: standard_user, moderator, admin
- User model created in GraphQL with proper authorization rules
- Post-confirmation Lambda creates user records automatically
- MFA optional with SMS and TOTP support
- OAuth credentials stored in environment variables

### Amplify UI Authenticator Configuration

The Authenticator component from Amplify UI React 6.1.0 provides pre-built authentication UI that integrates directly with the Cognito configuration from Story 1.2.

Key configuration needed in `components/auth/Authenticator.tsx`:
```typescript
import { Authenticator } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react';
import '@aws-amplify/ui-react/styles.css';
```

Social providers already configured in `amplify/auth/resource.ts`:
- Google OAuth
- Facebook OAuth

[Source: Story 1.2 completion notes]

### Required Sign-up Attributes

Based on the Cognito configuration from Story 1.2:
- email (required)
- username (required)
- preferred_username (optional)

The Authenticator component must collect these during sign-up using the `signUpAttributes` prop.

[Source: Story 1.2, amplify/auth/resource.ts configuration]

### File Locations

Based on the project structure:
- Auth wrapper: `components/auth/Authenticator.tsx`
- Auth guard: `components/auth/AuthGuard.tsx`
- Login page: `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`
- Register page: `app/(auth)/register/page.tsx`
- Auth layout: `app/(auth)/layout.tsx`
- Dashboard placeholder: `app/(dashboard)/page.tsx`
- Amplify provider: `components/ui/AmplifyProvider.tsx`
- Client setup: `lib/amplify/client.ts`
- Server setup: `lib/amplify/server.ts`

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

### Theme Integration

The project uses:
- **Amplify UI React 6.1.0** for authentication components
- **Material-UI (MUI) 5.15.0** for supplementary components
- Custom theme extending Amplify's design tokens

Theme configuration location: `lib/theme/theme.ts`

The Authenticator should use Amplify's ThemeProvider with custom tokens that match MUI theme colors for consistency.

### Responsive Breakpoints

Amplify UI provides a breakpoint system that should be used:
- Mobile: < 600px
- Tablet: 600px - 900px
- Desktop: > 900px

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md - Amplify UI React 6.1.0]

### Authentication Flow

From the architecture workflows:
1. User clicks Sign Up/Login
2. Authenticator handles Cognito interaction
3. Email verification for new users
4. Post-confirmation Lambda creates user profile (already implemented)
5. Successful auth returns tokens (ID, Access)
6. Redirect to authenticated dashboard

[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md - User Registration and Authentication Flow]

### Testing Requirements

**Framework**: Jest 29.7.0 + React Testing Library

**Coverage Target**: 80% for components

**Test Scenarios**:
- Authenticator renders correctly
- Social login buttons display
- Custom fields validation
- Error state handling
- Loading state display
- Responsive behavior

Test file location: `components/auth/Authenticator.test.tsx`

Mock requirements:
- Use MSW (Mock Service Worker) for mocking AWS services
- Mock Amplify Auth methods

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

### Security Considerations

- All authentication flows use TLS 1.3
- OAuth tokens stored securely by Amplify
- No credentials in code - use environment variables
- CORS properly configured for OAuth redirects

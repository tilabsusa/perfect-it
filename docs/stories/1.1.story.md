4. ESLint, Prettier, and Husky configured with pre-commit hooks
5. Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore for Amplify and Next.js
6. README.md created with setup instructions and project structure documentation
7. Development and production environment configurations separated
8. Amplify CLI configured and sandbox environment successfully deployed

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-08

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates solid foundational work for the AWS Amplify Gen 2 project initialization. All required components have been properly configured with appropriate versions matching the technical specifications. The project structure follows AWS Amplify best practices and the monorepo pattern is correctly established.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: .husky/pre-commit

  - **Change**: Added prettier check to pre-commit hook
  - **Why**: Ensures code formatting consistency before commits
  - **How**: Now enforces both linting and formatting standards automatically

- **File**: package.json
  - **Change**: Added prettier:check and prettier:write scripts
  - **Why**: Provides convenient commands for code formatting
  - **How**: Improves developer workflow and maintains consistency

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ ESLint configuration properly set up with TypeScript rules
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows the specified directory structure from architecture/source-tree.md
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Jest and Playwright properly configured with correct coverage settings
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 8 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

[x] Enhanced pre-commit hooks to include prettier formatting checks
[x] Added prettier scripts to package.json for better developer experience
[ ] Consider adding a pre-push hook for running tests
[ ] Add example test files to demonstrate testing patterns
[ ] Consider creating a CONTRIBUTING.md file with development guidelines

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. The .gitignore properly excludes sensitive files and the .env.local template follows best practices for environment configuration.

### Performance Considerations

The configuration is optimized for development with appropriate caching strategies in amplify.yml. The build configuration includes proper artifact handling and node_modules caching for faster deployments.

### Final Status

✓ Approved - Ready for Done

All acceptance criteria have been met, code quality standards are enforced, and the foundation is solid for feature development. The minor improvements suggested are enhancements rather than requirements.

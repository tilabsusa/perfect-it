# Story 1.2: Implement Authentication Backend with Cognito

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** platform owner,  
**I want** users to register and authenticate securely,  
**So that** we can protect user data and provide personalized experiences.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Amplify Auth resource configured with email/password and social providers (Google, Facebook)
2. User pool configured with required attributes (email, username, preferred_username)
3. Password policy set (minimum 8 characters, require numbers and special characters)
4. Email verification enabled for new registrations
5. Social provider OAuth flows configured and tested
6. User groups defined for future role-based access (standard_user, moderator, admin)
7. GraphQL schema includes User type with authentication rules
8. Lambda trigger configured for post-confirmation to initialize user profile data

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Story 1.1 successfully initialized the Amplify project with sandbox environment deployed
- Basic authentication directory structure already created at `amplify/auth/`
- Testing infrastructure (Jest and Playwright) already configured
- Amplify UI React 6.1.0 already installed and ready for use
- Current auth configuration only supports basic email authentication

### Current Authentication Configuration

The project currently has basic email-based authentication only:

```typescript
// Current configuration in amplify/auth/resource.ts
export const auth = defineAuth({
  loginWith: {
    email: true,
  },
});
```

This needs to be enhanced with OAuth providers and additional configuration. [Source: architecture/auth/resource.ts]

### User Data Model Structure

Implement the following User model in `amplify/data/resource.ts`:

```typescript
User: a.model({
  username: a.string().required(), // Unique display name
  email: a.email(), // Contact email (private)
  avatarUrl: a.url(), // Profile image S3 URL
  bio: a.string(), // User description (max 500 chars)
  expertiseTags: a.string().array(), // Areas of expertise
  reputationScore: a.integer().default(0), // Calculated reputation points
  isVerified: a.boolean().default(false), // Expert verification status
  socialLinks: a.json(), // Social media profiles
})
  .authorization((allow) => [
    allow.owner(), // User can manage own data
    allow.authenticated().to(['read']), // Authenticated users can read
    allow.guest().to(['read']), // Guests can read public data
  ])
  .secondaryIndexes((index) => [
    index('username'), // For username lookups
  ]);
```

### OAuth Provider Requirements

**Google OAuth:**

- Base URL: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth
- Requires Google Cloud Console project with OAuth 2.0 credentials
- Rate limit: 10,000 requests per day (free tier)
- Documentation: https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2

**Facebook OAuth:**

- Base URL: https://www.facebook.com/v18.0/dialog/oauth
- Requires Facebook App ID and App Secret from Developer Console
- Rate limit: 200 calls per hour per user
- Documentation: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login

Both providers are managed through Cognito Identity Providers configuration.

### Lambda Function Structure

Post-confirmation trigger location: `amplify/functions/post-confirmation/handler.ts`

The Lambda function should:

1. Receive Cognito post-confirmation event
2. Extract user attributes (sub, email, username)
3. Create User record in DynamoDB with Cognito sub as ID
4. Initialize default values (reputationScore: 0, isVerified: false)
5. Return success/failure to Cognito

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md, architecture/database-schema.md]

### Authorization Configuration

Configure in `amplify/data/resource.ts`:

```typescript
authorizationModes: {
  defaultAuthorizationMode: 'userPool',  // Cognito User Pool
  apiKeyAuthorizationMode: {
    expiresInDays: 30,
  },
}
```

User roles enum for future use:

```typescript
enum UserRole {
  GUEST = 'guest',
  USER = 'authenticated',
  MODERATOR = 'moderator',
  ADMIN = 'admin',
}
```

### Security Requirements

- **MFA**: Required for admin users, optional for others
- **MFA Methods**: SMS and TOTP authenticator apps
- **Password Policy**: Minimum 8 characters, require numbers and special characters
- **Data Encryption**: TLS 1.3 for all connections, DynamoDB encryption at rest
- **PII Handling**: Minimal collection, purpose limitation
- **Data Retention**: 90-day deletion policy for inactive accounts

### File Locations

- Auth configuration: `amplify/auth/resource.ts`
- Data model: `amplify/data/resource.ts`
- Backend config: `amplify/backend.ts`
- Post-confirmation Lambda: `amplify/functions/post-confirmation/handler.ts`
- Lambda tests: `amplify/functions/post-confirmation/handler.test.ts`

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

### Testing

**Testing Requirements:**

- **Framework**: Jest 29.7.0 for unit tests
- **Lambda Coverage Target**: 85% code coverage
- **Test File Location**: Create test files alongside Lambda function code
- **Integration Testing**: Use MSW (Mock Service Worker) for mocking AWS services
- **Test Scenarios**: User creation success, database failures, permission errors

Test the following:

1. Cognito configuration correctness
2. OAuth provider integration (manual testing in sandbox)
3. Lambda trigger execution and User record creation
4. Authorization rules on GraphQL schema
5. MFA configuration and enforcement

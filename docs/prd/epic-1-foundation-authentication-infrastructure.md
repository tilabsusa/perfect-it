# Epic 1: Foundation & Authentication Infrastructure

**Goal:** Establish the technical foundation with AWS Amplify Gen 2, implement secure authentication, and deploy a basic but functional application that proves the infrastructure works end-to-end. This epic delivers a live, accessible application with user registration and login capabilities, setting the stage for all future feature development.

### Story 1.1: Initialize Amplify Project and Repository Setup

As a developer,  
I want to set up the AWS Amplify Gen 2 project structure with Next.js and MUI,  
so that we have a properly configured development environment ready for feature implementation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Monorepo initialized with Next.js 14+ App Router and TypeScript configuration
2. AWS Amplify Gen 2 backend folder structure created with proper resource organization
3. Amplify UI React library configured with custom theme extending Amplify's design tokens, MUI v5 for supplementary components
4. ESLint, Prettier, and Husky configured with pre-commit hooks
5. Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore for Amplify and Next.js
6. README.md created with setup instructions and project structure documentation
7. Development and production environment configurations separated
8. Amplify CLI configured and sandbox environment successfully deployed

### Story 1.2: Implement Authentication Backend with Cognito

As a platform owner,  
I want users to register and authenticate securely,  
so that we can protect user data and provide personalized experiences.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Amplify Auth resource configured with email/password and social providers (Google, Facebook)
2. User pool configured with required attributes (email, username, preferred_username)
3. Password policy set (minimum 8 characters, require numbers and special characters)
4. Email verification enabled for new registrations
5. Social provider OAuth flows configured and tested
6. User groups defined for future role-based access (standard_user, moderator, admin)
7. GraphQL schema includes User type with authentication rules
8. Lambda trigger configured for post-confirmation to initialize user profile data

### Story 1.3: Create Authentication UI Components

As a user,  
I want intuitive sign-up and sign-in interfaces,  
so that I can easily access the platform and start using it.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Amplify UI Authenticator component integrated with custom theme and branding
2. Authenticator configured for email/password and social login (Google, Facebook)
3. Custom sign-up fields added for username and user preferences
4. Password reset and email verification flows handled by Authenticator
5. Custom header and footer slots utilized for branding consistency
6. Loading states and error handling configured in Authenticator
7. Responsive design with Amplify UI breakpoint system
8. Successful authentication redirects to authenticated home placeholder page

### Story 1.4: Build Landing Page and Navigation Shell

As a visitor,  
I want to understand what PerfectIt offers when I arrive at the site,  
so that I can decide whether to register and explore further.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Landing page with hero section explaining PerfectIt's value proposition
2. MUI AppBar with logo, navigation menu, and authentication buttons
3. Responsive navigation drawer for mobile devices
4. Call-to-action buttons linking to sign-up page
5. Footer with placeholder links for future pages (About, Terms, Privacy)
6. Authenticated state shows user menu with sign-out option
7. Next.js routing configured for all authentication pages
8. Basic SEO meta tags and Open Graph data configured

### Story 1.5: Configure Amplify Hosting and Deployment Pipeline

As a developer,  
I want automated deployment of the application,  
so that code changes are reliably pushed to production.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Amplify Hosting connected to Git repository main branch
2. Build settings configured for Next.js with proper environment variables
3. Custom domain configured (if available) or using Amplify-provided URL
4. Preview environments enabled for pull requests
5. CloudWatch logs accessible for debugging deployment issues
6. Environment variables properly configured for production
7. Health check endpoint created returning basic application status
8. Successfully deployed application accessible via public URL with working authentication

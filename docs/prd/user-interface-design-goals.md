# User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The PerfectIt interface embodies visual storytelling, where every interaction begins with an image. The design philosophy centers on "show, don't tell" - users should immediately understand an item's improvement potential through visual cues. The interface maintains a clean, uncluttered aesthetic that puts Perfection Cards front and center, with intuitive navigation that feels familiar to users of Pinterest and Instagram while offering the structured guidance of instructional platforms.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Visual-First Discovery:** Grid-based card browsing with prominent images, hover-to-preview details
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Cards expand from image thumbnail → summary → full instructions
- **Contextual Actions:** Upvote, save, and share buttons appear on hover/touch without cluttering the view
- **Guided Creation Flow:** Step-by-step wizard for creating Perfection Cards with real-time preview
- **Community Engagement:** Inline commenting and discussion threads that don't disrupt the visual flow

### Core Screens and Views
- Login/Registration Screen (social login options, minimal friction onboarding)
- Home Dashboard (personalized feed of trending and recommended Perfection Cards)
- Browse/Discover Page (category grid, filter sidebar, infinite scroll)
- Search Results Page (visual grid with relevance indicators)
- Perfection Card Detail View (hero image, instructions, materials, comments)
- Create Card Wizard (multi-step form with image upload, preview mode)
- User Profile Page (expertise badges, contributed cards, saved collections)

### Branding
Clean, modern aesthetic with craft-inspired touches. Warm, approachable color palette emphasizing earth tones and workshop colors (wood browns, tool grays, creative oranges). Typography balances readability with personality - clear sans-serif for instructions, subtle serif accents for headers. Visual language celebrates craftsmanship and improvement journey.
